};

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with Next.js and understand its core features.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, you can create a new Next.js application by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```
This command will set up a new Next.js project in a directory called `my-next-app`. Once the setup is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```
Now, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start your Next.js application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features

Next.js offers several powerful features that enhance the development experience:
- **File-based Routing**: Automatically creates routes based on the file structure in the `pages` directory.
- **API Routes**: Allows you to create API endpoints within your Next.js application.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for better performance and SEO.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server for dynamic content.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for faster loading times.

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that simplifies building modern web applications. With its rich feature set and ease of use, you can quickly develop high-performance applications. Explore the Next.js documentation for more in-depth tutorials and examples to further enhance your skills.
